# kaggle-titanic
This project is a part of my personal Data Science portifolio and uses the Titanic dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a model which can predict whether a given titanic passenger survived the sinking based solely on basic information that were present in the trip files.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Feature Engineering
* Ensemble Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-Learn
* Pandas
* Numpy
* XGBoost

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
